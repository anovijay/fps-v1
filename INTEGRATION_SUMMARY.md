# Email Batch Processing System - Refactoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the complete refactoring and integration plan for the Email Batch Processing System. The system now integrates with an LLM adapter service to process emails and attachments, extract insights, and save results to Firestore.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. âœ… Email Batch Collection with Attachment Info
- **File**: `batch_processor.py` - `collect_email_batch_with_attachments()`
- **Features**:
  - Collects emails from Firestore with "Scheduled for Extraction" status
  - Processes attachments and uploads them to Google Cloud Storage
  - Generates GCS URLs for each attachment
  - Updates Firestore with GCS URLs
  - Builds structured email objects with attachment metadata

### 2. âœ… Adapter Payload Construction
- **File**: `batch_processor.py` - `build_adapter_payload()`
- **Schema**:
```python
{
    "extraction_timestamp": "2025-06-21T18:21:35.601Z",
    "total_emails": 5,
    "emails": [
        {
            "id": "email_123",
            "subject": "Meeting Notes",
            "sender_email_id": "sender@example.com",
            "body": "Email content...",
            "has_attachments": true,
            "files": [
                {
                    "id": "file_456",
                    "file_name": "document.pdf",
                    "cloud_storage_url": "gs://rhea_incoming_emails/attachments/email_123/file_456_document.pdf"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. âœ… Adapter Service Integration
- **File**: `batch_processor.py` - `call_adapter_service()`
- **Features**:
  - POST requests to `/extract` endpoint
  - Configurable adapter service URL
  - 5-minute timeout for processing
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - JSON response parsing

### 4. âœ… Response Handling & Result Storage
- **File**: `batch_processor.py` - `handle_adapter_response()`
- **Expected Response Schema**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "results": {
    "email_id_1": {
      "Summary": "Meeting summary...",
      "ActionItems": ["Follow up on project", "Schedule next meeting"],
      "Urgency": "High",
      "files": {
        "file_id_1": {
          "Type": "Invoice",
          "sender": "vendor@company.com",
          "received_date": "2025-06-21",
          "Summary": "Invoice for services...",
          "Details": "Payment details...",
          "tags": ["invoice", "urgent"],
          "Urgency": "High"
        }
      }
    },
    "calendar_add_details": [
      {
        "date": "2025-06-25",
        "time": "14:00",
        "action": "Team Meeting",
        "source_mail_id": "email_id_1",
        "source_file_id": "file_id_1",
        "execution_details": { "location": "Conference Room A" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. âœ… Enhanced Storage Service
- **File**: `storage_service.py`
- **New Methods**:
  - `upload_attachment()` - Upload file content to GCS
  - `upload_attachment_from_path()` - Upload from local file path
  - `_sanitize_filename()` - Handle special characters in filenames
- **Features**:
  - Organized file storage: `attachments/{email_id}/{file_id}_{filename}`
  - Automatic filename sanitization
  - GCS URL generation

### 6. âœ… Enhanced Firestore Service
- **File**: `firestore_service.py`
- **New Methods**:
  - `save_extraction_result()` - Save email extraction results
  - `save_calendar_events()` - Save calendar events in batches
  - `update_file_gcs_url()` - Update file GCS URLs
- **New Collections**:
  - `extraction_results` - Stores LLM extraction results
  - `calendar_events` - Stores calendar events from emails

### 7. âœ… Configuration Management
- **File**: `config.py`
- **Features**:
  - Centralized configuration management
  - Environment variable support
  - Default values for all settings
  - Production/development environment detection

### 8. âœ… Example Usage & Documentation
- **File**: `example_usage.py`
- **Features**:
  - Complete usage examples
  - Configuration demonstration
  - Safe execution (commented main function)

## Configuration Options

Set these environment variables to configure the system:

```bash
# Required
export ADAPTER_SERVICE_URL='https://your-llm-adapter-service.run.app'

# Optional (with defaults)
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='rhea-461313'
export STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME='rhea_incoming_emails'
export MAX_BATCH_SIZE='50'
export ADAPTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS='300'
export ENVIRONMENT='production'
export LOG_LEVEL='INFO'
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from batch_processor import BatchProcessor

# Use default configuration
processor = BatchProcessor()
success = processor.process_batch()
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from batch_processor import BatchProcessor

# Custom adapter service URL
processor = BatchProcessor(adapter_service_url='https://my-adapter.run.app')
success = processor.process_batch()
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Run with default settings
python batch_processor.py

# Run with custom adapter URL
ADAPTER_SERVICE_URL='https://my-adapter.run.app' python batch_processor.py
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Fetch** emails with "Scheduled for Extraction" status from Firestore
2. **Upload** all attachments to Google Cloud Storage
3. **Build** adapter payload with email data and GCS URLs
4. **Call** LLM adapter service for extraction
5. **Process** response and save results to Firestore:
   - Email extraction results â†’ `extraction_results` collection
   - Calendar events â†’ `calendar_events` collection
6. **Update** email statuses to "Extracted"
7. **Update** file statuses to "Extracted"

## Status Transitions

- **Input Status**: "Scheduled for Extraction"
- **Output Status**: "Extracted" (on success) or "Failed" (on error)

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive logging with emoji indicators
- Graceful error handling for individual emails
- Service connection testing before processing
- Timeout handling for adapter service calls
- Proper status updates even on partial failures

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** the LLM adapter service to your cloud environment
2. **Update** `ADAPTER_SERVICE_URL` environment variable
3. **Test** with a small batch of emails
4. **Monitor** logs for any issues
5. **Scale** by adjusting `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` as needed

## Testing

All files have been syntax-checked and compile successfully:
```bash
âœ… batch_processor.py
âœ… storage_service.py  
âœ… firestore_service.py
âœ… config.py
âœ… example_usage.py
```

The refactoring is complete and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
